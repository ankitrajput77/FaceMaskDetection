## Introduction

Face Mask Detection is a computer vision project aimed at detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify faces into two categories: "With Mask" and "Without Mask." The motivation behind this project is to help enforce mask-wearing policies in public places and contribute to public health and safety during pandemics like COVID-19.

## Features

- Real-time face mask detection from images or live video streams.
- High accuracy due to the deep learning model used.
- Easy-to-use interface for both developers and end-users.
- Streamlit WebApp, Simple and accurate.
